        <span class="text">“Lead, Follow, or Get Out of the Way”</span> was the title of a <br>1981  biography of Ted Turner, who also had the saying
        <br> on a plaque on  his desk. <br> <br> In life there are leaders or at times it is you who must <br> take the role of leader.  Another option in life is to follow <br> the leader.  Nothing is wrong with being a follower, and <br> if this is your role in a situation, being a good follower is <br> just as important as being the leader.  And finally, there <br> are leaders and followers as well as those who just seem <br> to get in the way.  People who get in the way choose <br> not to lead or to follow but slow the progress of an  <br> individual or group that is striving towards a goal. This <br> quote has helped me in life and business.
